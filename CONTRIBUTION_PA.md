# Contribution

#Hello! I am contributing to this repository as part of the Introduction to GitHub exercise <Praise>\

#My contribution is to edit the code in exercise 1 (basic-github-commands.md) is that:\

#This line of code 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/introduction-to-github.git 
#should be edited as 
git clone https://github.com/SIFU-john/intro-to-github.git\

#<your-username> should be substituted with <SIFU-john> since the task is to clone SIFU John's repository on your local machine

#Also, 'introduction-to-github' should be edited to 'intro-to-github' because that's the correct name of the repository
